Write both the Code for the calculator and the unit tests

2.: FizzBuzz
The "FizzBuzz" code is provided, you need to write the Unit tests for the code.

3.: MyStringUtil
This time, the Unit tests are already written. Make the code for "MyStringUtil" so all unit tests passes.

4.: MyStack
Both the implementation of the Stack in MyStack and the unit tests for it is needed. 
Use Test Driven Development (TDD), where you first write a Unit test, then the code to make it pass, update or write a new unit test. And so on.
